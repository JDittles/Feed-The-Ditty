# Feed The Ditty

## SETUP

Python 2.7 is required.
So is Requests. To install navigate to the project root and install with pipenv:
```pipenv install requests```

Ain't nothing else you need.
```JUST RUN THE GD APP AM I RIGHT```

## DESCRIPTION

This guy is going to be a Python app for searching for recipes using Edamam's API.
Hopes are I learn to use Get requests and interact with APIs like a real man, not just a boy.

## FIRST STEP

The first leg is creating a search function that creates usable requests from the Edamam's database.

## POWER THAT SUCKER UP

Go ahead and run the test:
```TestScript.py```
